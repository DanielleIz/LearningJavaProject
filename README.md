# LearningJavaProject
Project for learning Java.

This is a project to help get an understanding of some of the basic functionality of Java programming. It provides a handy way
to complete the exercises in LearningJava.txt.

To get started, I recommend installing Java from AdoptOpenJDK: https://adoptopenjdk.net/

You should also install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
